# AI_pinelines_anticipate_vector_borne_diseases

# 1. Introduction
Vector-borne diseases are illness transmitted to human by infected mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. These diseases are highly concerned by public health due to their dynamic increases corresponding to climate change.
The current project investigates the potential of different AI pinelines to anticipate vector borne diseases. Over the past decades, many studies have been conducted to predict the epidemic of these deseases, but mostly using collected time-series datapoints. In the current project, we focus on anticipating vector-borne deseases based on image-based time-series representation. The rapid development of AI generations on image recognition and detection could help to predict the outbreaks. 
# 2. AI pinelines 
AI pineline refers to structured workflows utilized to develop, deploy and maintain machine learning models. It consists of various processes including data collection, data processing, data extraction , model training, model evaluation, model deployment, monitoring and maintenance, and feedback loop. Integration of AI pinelines help ensure AI solutions manageble and that models are robust, scalable and maintainable.
