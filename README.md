# AI_pinelines_anticipate_vector_borne_diseases

# 1. Introduction:
Vector-borne diseases are illness transmitted to human through the bite of infected mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. These diseases are highly concerned by public health due to rapid changes of climate change.
The current project investigates the potential of different AI pinelines to anticipate vector borne diseases. Over the past decades, many studies have been conducted to predict the epidemic of these deseases 
but mostly using collected time-series datapoints. In our project, we focus on anticipating vector-borne deseases based on image-based time-series representation and combined with different AI generations to extract image features and to predict the outbreaks.
