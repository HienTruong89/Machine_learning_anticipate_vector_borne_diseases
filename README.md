# AI_pinelines_anticipate_vector_borne_diseases

1. Introduction:
   Vector-borne diseases are illness transmitted to human through the bite of infected mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. These diseases are highly concerned by public health due to changes of climate change.
The current project investigates the potential of different AI pinelines to anticipate vector borne diseases 
Over the past decades, many studies have been conducted to predict the epidemic of vector-borne illness using collected datapoints.
